# Maximising Driver Revenue using Hypothesis Testing ðŸ§®ðŸš–

**Objective:**  
Analyze taxi payment data to uncover key patterns and use statistical hypothesis testing to recommend actionable strategies for maximizing driver revenue.

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Techniques Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
- **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis, T-Test, Hypothesis Testing

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Taxi drivers often experience inconsistent earnings due to various factors. This project investigates:
- What factors significantly impact driver revenue?
- Are certain payment types associated with higher revenues?
- Can we statistically validate patterns observed in the data?

## ðŸ“Œ Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Checked for missing values and duplicates
   - Standardized column formats and filtered relevant data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Explored trends in payment types, trip distances, and fare amounts
   - Visualized key metrics using matplotlib and seaborn

3. **Statistical Testing**
   - Formulated null and alternative hypotheses
   - Applied **T-Test** to compare mean revenue from different payment types
   - Evaluated p-values and test statistics to accept or reject the null hypothesis

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Identified which payment methods statistically yield higher earnings
   - Provided data-driven suggestions for driver revenue improvement

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

- Found that drivers earn statistically **more** through a Card payment method than Online method.
- Insights can guide drivers and fleet managers to optimize payment method preferences.
